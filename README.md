# AdventOfCode

This is my personal repository for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) Challenge.

My solutions are written in typescript with nodeJS.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm start
```

To run a specific day, just uncomment the function call with the specific day in the root index.ts file of the corresponding year.
